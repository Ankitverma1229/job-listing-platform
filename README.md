# Student Internship Platform

Welcome to the Student Internship Platform documentation. This platform is designed to facilitate students in creating profiles, earning coins, and applying for internships. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the platform effectively.

## Overview

The Student Internship Platform utilizes Node.js and Express.js as the backend framework, MongoDB as the non-relational database, and React.js for the frontend. It also incorporates JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.

## Core Functionalities

### üìù Authentication and User Management

- Users can register with their email address and receive an OTP for verification.
- Passwords are not required during registration; instead, OTPs are used for secure authentication.
- Token-based authentication is implemented using JWT for secure user login.

### üõ†Ô∏è Profile Building and Coin Earning

- Users can create detailed profiles, including personal details, education history, project details, and past experiences.
- Each field filled earns the user a specific number of coins, which are displayed in real-time as they fill in the input fields.

### üåê Internship Listings

- The platform fetches internship listings from Internshala API/Web Scraping.
- Internship details are displayed on cards, including role name, company name, company logo, CTC/Stipend, experience required, and an "Apply" button that costs 50 coins.

### üí∞ Coin Spending

- Users spend 50 coins for every internship application.
- The system checks if the user has sufficient coins before allowing the application process to proceed.
